<h1><strong>Analysing International Chess Federation Data To Highlight Sex Disparities</strong></h1>

This project aims to look at the skewed sex ratios among female players and the true reasons for male dominance in the sport.

I have downloaded the data from <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/download.phtml">International Chess Federation website</a> and I have also used <a href="https://github.com/xRuiAlves/fide-ratings-scraper/tree/master#api-documentation">this</a> API to extract timeseries data on Indian Grandmasters. All the data sheets are in this repository and the .ipynb file has the details of the analysis.
